This repository demonstrates common errors encountered when using React Router v6, specifically focusing on issues with route paths and missing imports.  The `bug.js` file contains code that exhibits these problems, while `bugSolution.js` offers corrected versions.

The primary issues addressed include:

* Incorrect path declarations in `Route` components.
* Missing or incorrect imports of necessary components from `react-router-dom`.
* Improper nesting of routes, leading to rendering issues.

The solution shows the correct way to structure the routing configuration, ensuring all paths are correctly defined and all components are properly imported and nested within the `Routes` component.
